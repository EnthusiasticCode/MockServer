/**

 A server which runs locally and "pretends" to be something else.

 You provide the server with an optional port to run on, and a list of responses.

 The responses consist of an array of arrays, in this format:
 pattern, command, command...

 The pattern is a regular expression which is matched against input received by the server.
 The commands are NSString, NSData, or NSNumber objects, which are processed when
 the pattern has been matched.

 See the [documentation](http://karelia.github.com/MockServer/Documentation/).

 See also the MockServerTests.m file for some examples.
